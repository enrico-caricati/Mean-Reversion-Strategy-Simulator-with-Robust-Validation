# Mean-Reversion-Strategy-Simulator-with-Robust-Validation
Research-oriented mean-reversion backtesting framework for single-asset time series. Models deviations from an SMA equilibrium, applies ADF and Hurst diagnostics, and evaluates a threshold-based strategy with transaction costs and train/validation/test splits.
